    "paragraph1": "I have 10 years of experience as a software developer and autodidactic enthusiasm. I led FrontEnd development and supervised backend developments as Technical Lead at Cencosud S.A., successfully establishing a non-relational data model for the post-purchase experience sector.",
    "paragraph2": "This planning served as a starting point to develop a solid transversal base in <strong>micro-frontend technology</strong>, which allowed consolidating cost reduction objectives of up to 30% in relation to third-party dependent services, many of which lacked stability and operability affecting the purchasing flow for clients in the company."
